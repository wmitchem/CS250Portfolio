## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stores" help with this?
User stories are an essential component of development because they provide a view into what functionality users need and expect. A user story is effectively a use case for the software; an essential representative of a problem the software needs to solve. A collection of user stories, once adequately addressed, will produce a robust service or software that is well engineered and tested that meets the demands of the majority of its users. Without user stories, you're building software solely off of how you imagine someone would use it. Those assumptions may be accurate, but in most cases, they won't be exhaustive enough to cover the gamut of functionality. The initial release of a new software product or feature is a very significant point in its lifecycle; you only get one first impression. If the software releases without considering the users, even if it eventually does become a solid piece of software, the perception of the public will be difficult to change.

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Realistically, most Agile processes will be incorporated into my future developmental work. Scrum is very common in the software development space, so almost all of the content of this course will be directly actionable for my future employment. 

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development requires commitment to your craft and a strict neutral approach. It's about being a team player, communicating clearly and fairly, and developing both software and your relationships with your team. During communication, a good team member will criticize ideas rather than people. A good team member will also willingly share their experience and assist/mentor others in their team, so that the quality of the team's work will 
improve across the board.
