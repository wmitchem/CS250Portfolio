## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stores" help with this?
User stories are an essential component of development because they provide a view into what functionality users need and expect. A user story is effectively a use casae for the software; an essential representative of a problem the software needs to solve. A collection of user stories, once adequately addressed, will produce a robust service or software that is well engineered and tested that meets the demands of the majority of its users.
